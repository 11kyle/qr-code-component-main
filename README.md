## Overview
This is my first project on Frontend Mentor so I'm going with a newbie project that I like, the qr-code-component. I want to over estimate on my first project because I think that it's better than under estimating. I also want to be close on my estimation because I feel like that is very important in a professional environment. I also want to note that I'm currently not using the Pro version so I don't have access to the Figma files but I do want to incorporate a designing and project plan phase in my estimate.

- Planning: 0.5 hours
- Analysis: 0.5 hours
- Design: 0 (Already completed)
- Development: 1 hour
- Testing: 1 hour
- Maintenance: 0 (Not in the scope)

Total: 3 hours

## My process

- Planning: My planning for this small project was minimal. I didn't document a project plan.
- Analysis: I selected which languages, frameworks and foundations to use. They are TailwindCSS, Create React App, GitHub Pages. I've been focusing on learning TailwindCSS and that's why is chose it over others like Bootstrap.
- Development: Used VS Code as my IDE. I have experience with MacOS and Windows but chose Windows for this project.
- Testing: Included opening the project in multiple browers and different screen sizes. Also, tested on my iPhone with Safari and Google Chrome by hosting my solution on Github Pages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned about hsl colors. Before this I had only worked with hex and rgb (rgba) colors. I gained more experience with custom theming in TailwindCSS but would like to learn more. It had been awhile since I deployed a project with GitHub Pages so it was good to quickly pick up that knowledge again. I'm getting much faster with TailwindCSS especially with flex, box model and layouts in general.

I'd like to point out how impressed I am with the design of this project and others I see on Frontend Mentor. These are great for developers who want to build a beautiful portfolio but struggle to think of projects and the design of those projects.

### Continued development

I would like to spend more time using Figma and calculation project plans.
